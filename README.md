# Conways's Game of Life

With my limited knowledge of css, I think the grid layout (by setting `grid-auto-columns` and `grid-auto-rows` to `1fr`) can be used as a hacky way to implement the infinite field. But since I am using a bunch of `<span>` elements to represent the cells, it would be super slow anyway. [The demo implemented by copy](https://github.com/copy/life) looks amazing and I hope to have time to look deeper into that later.

Lots of other cool features can be added (say generate a new game by different patterns), but I currently don't have time for that. Still I hope you enjoy this [minimal demo](http://kumom.info/conways/)!
